Consistent with this change, and beginning March 2021, Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront will begin migrating the Certificate Authority for each services’ default certificate. Using our own Certificate Authority, AWS services can better manage the security practices used to handle our default certificates.\n\nYour action may be required to ensure your applications continue normal operation after this change. If you already use other AWS services, your application most likely already trusts Amazon Trust Services as many AWS services have already migrated. Visit [5]https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/ for more information about Amazon Trust Services.\n\nTo prepare for this migration, visit the announcement blog or review the FAQs below:\n[6]https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prepare-for-aws-move-to-its-own-certificate-authority/\n\nIf you have additional questions, or require additional assistance, please open a case in the AWS Support Center: [7]https://aws.amazon.com/support\n\nPlease also monitor each services’ AWS Forums page for future updates as the migration date approaches:\nAmazon S3 Forum [8]https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=24\nAmazon CloudFront Forum [9]https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=46\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ1: What is changing?\nThe certificate authority for Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront’s default certificates are changing from DigiCert to Amazon Trust Services. For S3, many regions already use Amazon Trust Services including all regional endpoints for the eu-west-3, eu-north-1, me-south-1, ap-northeast-3, ap-east-1, and us-gov-east-1 regions. S3 will be migrating the remaining AWS regions to Amazon Trust Services as well. For CloudFront, all edge locations will be migrating to Amazon Trust Services.\n\nThis does change does not impact workloads that use HTTP only or use a custom SSL/TLS certificate.\n\nQ2: When are these changes occurring?\nThe changes in Certificate Authority will begin rolling out on March 1, 2021.\n\nQ3: What do I need to do?\nEvaluate whether your applications trust Amazon Trust Services’ root certificates. If your application does not trust Amazon Trust Services, perform one of the following two actions. Resolution option 1, update your client certificate trust store to include all of Amazon Trust Services’ root certificates. Resolution option 2, change the domain name your application requests to a CloudFront Alternative Domain Name (CNAME) that uses an SSL/TLS certificate from an already trusted Certificate Authority.\n\nQ4: How do I test if my application trust Amazon Trust Services?\nVerify your application works with Amazon Trust Services issued certificates, by performing one of the following tests from within your application. Test option 1, fetch the object [10]https://s3-ats-migration-test.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/test.jpg and verify a 200 response or that you see the green check mark in the test image. Test option 2, create an S3 bucket in your AWS account in any of the following regions (eu-west-3, eu-north-1, me-south-1, ap-northeast-3, ap-east-1, and us-gov-east-1) and fetch a test object.\n\nQ5: What root certificates are part of Amazon Trust Services?\nRefer to [11]https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/ for the current list.\n\nQ6: What happens after March 1, 2021 if my clients do not trust Amazon Trust Services’ Certificate Authorities?\nAll client requests made to a default Amazon S3 or Amazon CloudFront endpoint will receive a default certificate issued from Amazon Trust Services. If the client trust store does not trust the Certificate Authority, it may close the connection and report the SSL certificate as “untrusted.”\n\nSincerely,\nAmazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of [12]Amazon.com, Inc. [13]Amazon.com is a registered trademark of [14]Amazon.com, Inc.

This certificate includes the primary domain helpdesk.nypublicradio.org and a total of 2 domains.\n\nAWS account ID: 493123279066\nAWS Region name: us-east-1\nCertificate identifier: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:493123279066:certificate/fd09822a-2f70-4528-bda4-1d447df0a0f8\n\nAWS Certificate Manager (ACM) was unable to renew the certificate automatically using DNS validation. You must take action to ensure that the renewal can be completed before Mar 22, 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC. If the certificate is not renewed and the current certificate expires, your website or application may become unreachable.\n\nTo renew this certificate, you must ensure that the proper CNAME records are present in your DNS configuration for each domain listed below. You can find the CNAME records for your domains by expanding your certificate and its domain entries in the ACM console. You can also use the DescribeCertificate command in the ACM API[1] or the describe-certificate operation in the ACM CLI[2] to find a certificate’s CNAME records. For more information, see Automatic Domain Validation Failure in the ACM troubleshooting guide[3].\nThe following 2 domains require validation:\nhelpdesk.nypublicradio.org, helpdesk.wnyc.org\n\nIf you have questions about this process, you can contact the Support Center[4].

We have completed this update for all Classic Load Balancers. However, we have not modified the behavior of the Classic Load Balancer(s) in the US-EAST-1 Region listed below, as we detected that this could impact the behavior of the underlying application. The behavior for all remaining Classic Load Balancers will be updated on January 15, 2020, if they have not been changed already.\n\npublisher-prod-elb\n\nThe new behavior relates to the way your application handles single line feeds (‘\\n’) in the request header. If it treats a single line feed (‘\\n’) in the request header as a newline (‘\\r\\n’), your application may not be impacted by the new behavior and we recommend you enable the update on your load balancer via instructions contained in the PDF at [1]. If this is not the case you should update your application logic before enabling the new behavior on your load balancer. To assist you in the investigation you can make use of the “diagnosis” script [4].\n\nTo enable the update on your Classic Load Balancer(s), follow the instructions contained in the PDF [2] to apply a policy to your load balancer, or you can use the “update” script [3], which will use the AWS CLI to add additional configuration to your existing policies without overwriting existing settings.
